WinshoeTunnel Components are composed from two components, one is SlaveTunnel and
the other is MasterTunnel. They don't have Winshoe appended in front cause it get
a very long name. I you think that I must append Winshoe then let me know.
So, tunneling is the process where we pass many connections through a single one.
It is primarly done in VPNs (Virtual private networks) for encryption of sensitive
data. That was my reason also. I developed a secure encrypted Tunnel also with data
compression. But thats another story...
So, we have two pieces a Slave and a Master. Clients like browsers and ftp clients 
connect to the Slave and then they are routed through a single connection to the
Master. Master demultiplexes that stream of data, processes the requests and send
data back to the Slave part. Slave part demultiplexes data and sends data to clients.
And everyone is happy.


Usage

You can use WinshoeTunnel Components to create a bounded tunnel, that is bounded
to a single service application on the Master side or you can use it like a Socks
Deamon tunneling router. You can connect many Slaves to one Master, and you can
connect many clients to a Slave. I tested with a hundereds, but it may become 
unstable with over 100 clients because of the nature of Windows TCP stack. If you
test it on a single machine connections double!


Parameters

MasterTunnel
=======================
Port: 9000     
It must be 9000. This is the port on which tunnel runs. I can't 
hide this property, but you should not modify it.

LockDestination
If you lock destination, then only allowed application host is determined
by MappedHost and MappedPort properties.

MappedHost      If you lock destination, clients get to this host.

MappedPort      If you lock destination, clients get to this port.


SlaveTunnel
=======================
MasterHost      The host where the MasterTunnel runs.

Port            Port on which SlaveTunnel accepts connections.

Socks4          If SlaveTunnel should run like a Socks4 Deamon turn this property
                to True.


Attention!!!

You must first run MasterTunnel and then SlaveTunnel to get some results.
