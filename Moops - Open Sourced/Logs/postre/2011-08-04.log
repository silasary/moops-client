> WELCOME TO LAMBDACORE
> Getting Started with your LambdaCore MOO
> ========================================
> 
> Thank you for choosing LambdaCore!
> 
> Initial Setup Notes
> -------------------
> 
> The "welcome" screen, seen when a player connects.
>   -- this is stored in $login.welcome_message
> 
> Do you want on-line character creation?
>   -- this is stored in $login.create_enabled
>      for more detailed information, edit $login:player_creation_enabled
> 
> Do you want to limit the number of players on the MOO at once?
>   -- look at $login.max_connections
>      the `connection_limit' message on $login is the message printed
>      when this limit is reached.
> 
> Do you want a different default player class?
>   -- set $player_class to a different value
>      *do not* change $player
> 
> You should also set the following:
>   $network.postmaster
>     -- your email address, or the email address of the person who will 
>        handle your email
>   $network.site
>     -- the machine your MOO is running on (e.g. "lambda.moo.mud.org")
>   $network.port
>     -- the port your MOO is running on (e.g. 8888)
>   $network.MOO_Name
>     -- the name of your MOO (e.g. "LambdaMOO")
>   $site_db.domain
>   -- this is set to the `domain' of your address
>      (eg `foo.com' for `moo.foo.com')
> 
> If you compiled the server with open_network_connection() enabled (allowing the MOO to open up connections with
>  other computers on the network), then you should set
>   $network.active = 1
>      This will enable @newpassword, @registerme, @password, @mailme, @netforward, and others to send mail from the
>  MOO.
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> Setting Yourself Up
> -------------------
> 
> Set a password for yourself.
>   -- @password <new-password>
> 
> Set a description for yourself.
>   -- @describe me as <anything>
> 
> Set a gender for yourself.
>   -- @gender <gender>
> 
> There are, also, a large number of messages you can set on yourself.  Setting them will enhance the virtual
>  reality.
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> About Guests
> ------------
> 
> To make a new Guest character:
>   -- @make-guest <guestname>
>      will make a new guest with the name you specify with `_Guest' appended
>      and some other standard but useful aliases
> 
> This is the easiest way to make Guest characters.  The most important things to remember about Guests, if you want
>  to make them yourself, are:
>   -- make them owned by nonwizards, and not owned by themselves
>   -- make sure they've got .password == 0, and that .password is nonclear
>   -- at least one Guest must always be named `Guest'; this can be an alias
> 
> To set the default description and gender for a guest:
>   -- set .default_description to the description the guest should start with
>   -- set .default_gender to the gender the guest should start with
>   -- remember to set .description and .gender too, for the guest's first use
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> Adding to the Newspaper
> -----------------------
> 
> The newspaper is a special mailing list.  To add a post to the newspaper, send mail to it (as *News or $news), and
>  then note the number of your post (let's call it <x> and:
>   -- @addnews <x> to *News
> ... in general, `@addnews $ to *News' will work as well.
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> Quota
> -----
> 
> By default, LambdaCore runs with object-based quota.  This is the quota system documented in the LambdaMOO
>  Programmer's Manual, directly supported by the server.  If you're satisfied with object-based quota, which serves
>  some people's needs better than others', you needn't change anything.  However, an in-DB quota system, limiting
>  users by total database space as opposed to total objects, has been designed, and is included here.
> 
> To enable byte-based quota:
>   -- set $quota_utils to $byte_quota_utils
>   -- start the measurement task; see `help routine_tasks' for more information (Note: this help topic contains
>  information about more than just the quota task; it should be read regardless of how quota is set).
> 
> It's best that you make this switch before users start, because converting existing object-based users to
>  byte-based users is an awkward (and inherently arbitrary and political) move.  You'd need to decide how much
>  space your builders deserve, and it's all a mess.
> 
> -------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> Making Programmers
> ------------------
> 
> The command to turn someone into a programmer is `@programmer'  Its syntax is `@programmer <user>'.  For example:
>   -- @programmer Haakon
> The `@programmer' verb will prompt you if the user isn't set up with a description and a gender.
> 
> No code to automatically grant programmer bits is included with LambdaCore.
> 
> Making Wizards
> --------------
> 
> THINK CAREFULLY.
> 
> Be very careful before giving someone a wizard bit.  That person can do gross damage to your database, and fixable
>  but serious damage to the machine it runs on.  That person can quite possibly open outbound network connections
>  from your machine, and thus commit acts for which your host system will be blamed.  That person can ruin your
>  MOO's as-yet-untarnished reputation.
> 
> Wizards have technical power, the ability to change anything within the database, to create anything within the
>  database.  Be careful with the idea of a `Social Wizard' -- a nontechnical person holding a wizard bit is fairly
>  likely to, at some point, accidentally do something destructive.  It's a good idea not to socialize as your
>  wizard character, for the same reason, to make it less likely to be accidentally destructive.
> 
> That said, in general you don't turn an existing character into a wizard, you make a -new- character to be the
>  wizard.  This is because the existing character probably owns code and objects which could be destructive if
>  suddenly made wizardly; it's a good security measure to make a fresh player.  So, to make a fresh player:
>   -- @make-player (see `help @make-player' for more information)
>      this will make you a new player. for this example, #123
> 
> To make #123 a wizard:
>   -- @programmer #123
>      (a nonprogrammer wizard is a truly strange beast)
>   -- ;#123.wizard = 1;
>   -- @chparent #123 to $wiz
>   -- ;#123.public_identity = <the player's nonwizard character's object number>

Unlike the other corridors and rooms, this room holds a slight feeling of impending doom. The yellow crystals set in the ceiling glow inadaquetly, barely providing enough light to the room. The walls are lined with Mahogany shelves, currently devoid of any items. It's kinda creepy.
