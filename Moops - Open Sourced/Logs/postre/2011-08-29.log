> Userlist now supports status icons (idle, away, idle+away).
>   It also handles a couple more backend messages (icon-url and icons)
> Also fixed a few bugs with the VMOO link implementation. 
>   Note that @[[[ansi:"links"] don't work. (But at least they don't link anymore.
> We also now have half-decent Linux/OSX support 
>   (Don't quote me on the OSX support, my mac doesn't do mono)
>   The current *nix support doesn't do any ANSI.  It's my next priority.

> Subject:  NPCs
> 
> I've implemented basic NPC functionality.
> 
> To set up an NPC, you create a $npc, and set his .modules property.
> .modules is an array of modules. ie: {{action, target, args, starttime, stoptime}, ...}.  
>   Action is the action/module being run (IE: Walk, Wander, Sit, Attack, etc).
>   Target is the target of the module.  It's purpose varies from module to module, but it's usually a player, room or item.
>   args is the args passed to the module.  Again, see the module in question for what it does.
>   Starttime and Stoptime are integers representing the hour on a 24 hour clock.  An NPC will only run the module if the time is between starttime (inclusive) and stoptime (non-inclusive).
> 
> We currently have one NPC, named Steve.  At 7am he walks to the Reception. at 10 am, he goes to the bank for an hour, before returning to the reception at 11.  At 5pm he goes to Study room 1 in the Library, and will begin to wander within two rooms of there until midnight.  Then he will return to Study Room 1, and wait until 7am the next day.
> 
> His modules look like this:
> {{"walk", #62, {}, 7, 10}, {"walk", #193, {}, 10, 11}, {"walk", #62, {}, 11, 17}, {"walk", #550, {"Wander", #550, {2, 24}, E_NONE}, 17, 24}, {"walk", #550, {}, 0, 7}}
> 
> Note that while Steve doesn't have any overlapping modules, it is possible to do so, and the NPC will randomly choose between them whenever they don't have a task to do.
> 
> Modules can be defined in two places.  On the NPC themselves (IE: $rpg_mob should define attack), or on $ai_utils (if the module is useful for all NPCs).  The verb must be called "_module" (ie: _walk, _attack).  If a module is defined on both the NPC and on $ai_utils, the NPC's version will be prefered.
