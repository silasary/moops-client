> [03:01][+][Social] Silasary nods.
> [03:02][+][Social] R4000 says, "also atm"
> [03:02][+][Social] R4000 says, "because of a lack of content"

> [03:04][+][Social] R4000 says, "walking from the top of the 'now' part, to the bottom of it, would prob take about 2 or 3 days."

> [03:06][+][Social] R4000 says, "a quick rough guess if we ported all l2 content that would work in moo, and structure it room based so we could... easy over a million rooms"
> [03:06][+][Social] Silasary nods.

> [03:07][+][Social] R4000 nods.
> [03:08][+][Social] R4000 thinks, "tbh i think it should be done on a $zone -> $place -> $room method"
> [03:08][+][Social] R4000 says, "only updating if somebody is in one"
> [03:08][+][Social] R4000 says, "and upon entry/exit if needed"
> [03:09][+][Social] Silasary nods.
> [03:09][+][Social] Silasary says, "agreed."
> [03:09][+][Social] R4000 says, "so 3 loops, check if anybody is in the zone, if so, check the place, if so, check the room, if so, update the weather"
> [03:09][+][Social] R4000 says, "suprisingly simple :/"
> [03:09][+][Social] R4000 loves MOO.
> [03:10][+][Social] R4000 grins, "i think the code to do that in L2 is about 300 lines xD"
> [03:10][+][Social] Silasary says, "It'd have to run the entire zone, not just one room."
> [03:10][+][Social] R4000 hmms thoughtfully.
> [03:10][+][Social] Silasary says, "otherwise things go really badly really quickly."
> [03:10][+][Social] R4000 asks, "would be better to do the place?"
> [03:10][+][Social] Silasary says, "Place would also work."
> [03:10][+][Social] R4000 says, "chances are rivers and shit wont run between places"
> [03:11][+][Social] Silasary asks, "Streets -> Sewers?"
> [03:11][+][Social] R4000 nods.
> [03:11][+][Social] R4000 grins, "the rivers code seems a bit odd to me xD"
> [03:11][+][Social] Silasary nods.
> [03:11][+][Social] R4000 says, "its a non-physical river"
> [03:11][+][Social] Silasary says, "It makes sense to me."
> [03:11][+][Social] Silasary says, "I'm basing this on how weather works in the real world."
> [03:12][+][Social] R4000 says, "well... if a river was flowing down the high street... you wouldn't be walking through it"
> [03:12][+][Social] Silasary grins.
> [03:12][+][Social] Silasary says, "True."
> [03:12][+][Social] R4000 says, "its nice"
> [03:12][+][Social] Silasary says, "But the sewers are meant to stop that."
> [03:12][+][Social] R4000 says, "but it should block exits"
> [03:12][+][Social] R4000 asks, "you have the direction right?"
> [03:12][+][Social] R4000 asks, "and the direction the user came from on entry?"
> [03:13][+][Social] Silasary says, "I disagree.  But it should sweep you in the direction of the current."
> [03:13][+][Social] R4000 says, "'You attempt to cross the river, the current is strong and sweeps you south.'"
> [03:13][+][Social] Silasary hmms thoughtfully.
> [03:14][+][Social] Current Topic: Due to circumstances beyond our control, the planet is still spinning. (set by R4wizard[asleep]).
> [03:14][+][Social] R4000 says, "'You attempt to cross the river, the current is weak and you swim safely to the other side and continue on your journey.'"
> [03:15][+][Social] R4000 says, "and on attempt to use the exit"
> [03:15][+][Social] R4000 asks, "'There is a river blocking the way, attempt to swim across? [yes or no]"
> [03:15][+][Social] R4000 says, "river/lake"
> [03:15][+][Social] R4000 pbtpbtpbts, "lake should block all exits? :P"
> [03:15][+][Social] Silasary nods.
> [03:16][+][Social] R4000 says, "you could walk around a lake i guess :/"
> [03:16][+][Social] R4000 says, "i'll have to disable most of the river code in the rpg"
> [03:16][+][Social] R4000 says, "because water will play a huge part in the game"
> [03:16][+][Social] Silasary nods.
> [03:17][+][Social] R4000 says, "well"
> [03:17][+][Social] R4000 says, "not huge"
> [03:17][+][Social] R4000 says, "but there will be fixed lakes (quite big), with mobs in them"
> [03:17][+][Social] Silasary nods.
> [03:17][+][Social] Silasary says, "I need to deal with multi-room lakes."
> [03:17][+][Social] R4000 nods.
> [03:17][+][Social] Silasary says, "but lakes are easy to make."
> [03:18][+][Social] Silasary says, "Just set the room height to a large negative number, and it'll just form a lake."
> [03:18][+][Social] R4000 nods.
> [03:18][+][Social] R4000 says, "good and bad"
> [03:18][+][Social] R4000 says, "what about a lake on a river..."
> [03:18][+][Social] Silasary says, "If the water is high enough to spill over the lake, it'll continue downstream."
> [03:19][+][Social] R4000 says, "but if the surrounding rooms are positive numbers"
> [03:19][+][Social] Silasary nods.
> [03:19][+][Social] R4000 says, "then nothing is downstream"
> [03:19][+][Social] Silasary says, "No."
> [03:19][+][Social] R4000 pbtpbtpbts, "or does it just choose the lowest exit? :P"
> [03:19][+][Social] Silasary says, "no"
> [03:19][+][Social] R4000 raises an eyebrow.
> [03:19][+][Social] R4000 asks, "how then?"
> [03:20][+][Social] Silasary says, "Total Water height = room hieght + water height. "
> [03:20][+][Social] Silasary says, "If there is a room with a total hight lower than this room's total height, consider it as a valid downstream."
> [03:21][+][Social] Silasary says, "Of them, the one with the lowest total hight is The downstream."
> [03:21][+][Social] Silasary says, "So if we have a lake with height -2000, and water 2500, it's total height is 500."
> [03:22][+][Social] R4000 says, "i see"
> [03:22][+][Social] Silasary says, "If there is am adjacent room with height 100, and water 200, it's total height is 300, and is downstream."
> [03:22][+][Social] R4000 says, "but only 500 water can flow downstream"
> [03:22][+][Social] Silasary nods.
> [03:22][+][Social] R4000 asks, "until the adjacent room has 350?"
> [03:22][+][Social] R4000 says, "then they are level"
> [03:23][+][Social] Silasary nods.
> [03:23][+][Social] Silasary says, "And then they stall until that room flows downstream itself."
> [03:23][+][Social] R4000 says, "btw, we could increase the tick limit if you ever needed it"
> [03:23][+][Social] Silasary nods.
> [03:24][+][Social] R4000 says, "its 30,000 atm"
